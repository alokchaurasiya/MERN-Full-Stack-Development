    <h3>Images may be two or three-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen display,<br>
         or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by<br>
          optical devices such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, <br>
          etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or water.<br>

        The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional<br>
         figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, a painting or a banner. In this<br>
          wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing,<br>
           the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or computer <br>
           graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods, especially
            in a pseudo-photograph.<br></h3><hr>
